**T**ransit and **R**adial velocity **I**nteractive **F**itting tool for **O**rbital analysis and **N**-body simulations

Very powerfull and fast GUI tool for exoplanet orbital analysis. It uses a brang new RV fitting library called "RVmod", which can model the Stellar reflex motion caused by dynamicaly interacting planets in multi planetary systems.

**WARNING!** This tool is under active development and its functionality is enhanced on a daily basis! Therefore, the version you download today may not be fully compatible with the next uploaded version! Use at your own risk!

What works:

* Periodograms
* RVs Keplerian and Dynamical modeling + GP (only one GP kernel integrated so far)
* RVs MCMC sampling/modeling 
* Long-term stability check of multiplanet systems using Swift/SyMBA
* Various of interactive plots 
* Import/Export of working sessions and multi-sessions 
* Text editor/Calculator/Bash-shell widgets
* Integrated Jupyter widget

What is to be implemented:

* Transit modeling
* Combined Transit + RV + Astrometry +  GP/Moving avarage modeling 
* Variouse of minimization methods
* Some more GUI plots and plot functionality 
* GUI accsess to parameter limits and priors
* more Swift N-body integrators
* Many minor glitches and bugs to be fixed.
