**T**ransit and **R**adial velocity **I**nteractive **F**itting tool for **O**rbital analysis and **N**-body simulations

Very powerfull and fast GUI tool for exoplanet orbital analysis. It uses a brang new RV fitting library called "RVmod", which can model the Stellar reflex motion caused by dynamicaly interacting planets in multi planetary systems.
