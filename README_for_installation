##############################  LINUX  #########################################

For Debian based OS the only thing you have to do is to run:
 
bash linux_debian_install.sh

the script will automatically check if your system is RVmod/TRIFON ready 
and will ask you to install packages if needed. Particularly you will need:

gfortran
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
PyQt5
csh
jupyter
dill
emcee 
corner 
celerite
batman
qtconsole
+ the swift N-body library, which is in the ./source directory

# You may also need:

setuptools
pip 
rxvt



The program works for Python 2 and Python 3, but so far I suggest Python 2 
installation since some MCMC problems with Py3 have been encountered, and 
not yet fixed.


if "linux_debian_install.sh" was executed with no problems, then
you are ready to go! Just type:


python gui.py   


################################  MAC OS  ######################################
Similar instructions as above are for MAC OS. These are tested and worked 
straight away on a "clean" Mac OS X installation (Sierra 10.13). Just run:

bash MAC_OS_install.sh


Before that you will need to install "homebrew" which requires sudo privileges 
To install "homebrew", open terminal and type:

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"



I had problems with pip install of batman, in particular with the local
numpy installation.With "pip" install it seems that the numpy headers are here:

/Users/trifontrifonov/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy


Therefore a copy of the header dir fixed the problem

cp -r /Users/trifontrifonov/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy /usr/local/include

If you experineced the same problem after the "cp -r..." run again:

bash MAC_OS_install.sh

and all shoud be Ok now! (you may skip the swift instalation if you have
installed the lib the first time.

Alternativly, I have added batman-package in the cource directory and 
the script may do a local install in ./lib. You will be asked fro this 
option if batman is not on your system already.

########################### Some known problems   ##############################
################################################################################
 
 


Running the "emcee" with Python3 using multiprocessing results to:
TypeError: cannot serialize '_io.TextIOWrapper' object.

(No Problems with Py2 or Py3 with only one thread)

The problem and it seems to be that some part of the object RVmod object 
is not picklable. (work in progress here)

 


 

############################## Finally #################################

# to load the GUI  + Rvmod 

python gui.py 
 
# if you want to use RVmod on the Python shell

import RVmod as rv 
 
(but the RVmod directory must be in your path!)




Some comments:

* All fortran and python codes in this version need very 
serious clean up from junk.

* All fortan code must be translated with f2py.

* The transit fitting with more than one planet and together with RV 
is still not fully integrated.

* A pip installer must be made.

* Bugs are likely to occur!
