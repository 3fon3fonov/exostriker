Performing an orbital evolution
===============================

At this point we can perform an orbital evolution, using the *SyMBA N-body
symplectic integrator*, in order to notice how the orbital parameters develop with time.
In the following tutorial the system consists of two planets.

First the stellar parameters need to be distinguished, by changing the values
of *Stellar param.* on the I/O parameters section. Then add the maximum time of evolution
by clicking at *N-body* and the appropriate time step. Running orbital evolution **(Run orb. evol)** automatically redirects
to the *Orb. Evol* section, where the orbital parameters evolution is revealed.

Generally, the **AMD stable inidicator**, at the Statistics and control section, automatically indicates if a system is stable, by turning into green. 
Besides that, evaluating the stability of a system means that the orbital parameters have to be examined long-term (e.g 1Myr) and with a time
step of at least 100 points per orbit. For example, if the inner planet has a period of 200 days, then a time step of 2 
days is required. In case of planet-planet close encounters *SyMBA* automatically reduces the time step to ensure
an accurate simulation with high orbital resolution. *SyMBA* also checks for planet-planet or planet-star collisions or
planetary ejections and interrupts the integration if they occur. 

!! Say some words about MVS & MVS_GR integrators !!

Test arbitrary configuration
============================

In the *test arbitrary configuration* section orbital evolution tests with fixed values of planetary
parameters can be run and their evolution parameters can be examined.

Options between the planets RV amplitude & period **or** planets mass & semimajor axis are
provided. In the previous tutorial we test a two planet system.
