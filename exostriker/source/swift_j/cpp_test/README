This directory contains a test to help determine which precompiler
flags to set.  As in the main SWIFT directory, edit the @make file and
set the following variables:

     FORTRAN   which is the command on your machine to run the Fortran 
                 compliler
     FFLAGS    which are the flags you use for your Fortran. Here you
                 do not include the flag that stops fortran from
                 trying to link the program.  (In addition for SyMBA
                 users, the flags must be set so that recursion will
                 work on your machine.)  

Then type `@make'.  This will try to compile the 4 fortran programs in
this directory.  These programs contain the various ways in which
fotran compilers handle different situations.  @make will tell you
which CCPFLAGS to use.  We think that the output of @make is self
explanatory.
