Subject: Compiling latest Swift on HPs
Message-Id: <Pine.HPP.3.96.980408101409.10387B-100000@calvin>

To compile Swift on our HPs, the following needs to be changed in the
default @make files that come with the distribution:
	
For swift/@make:
-Change the FFLAGS line so that it reads
	set FFLAGS='-O -c'

-Change the CPPFLAGS line so that it reads:
	set CPPFLAGS='-P -U_OPEN_POSITION -U_RECUR_SUB'
(the -P flag is the one which gets rid of the extra stuff that was being 
printed in the precompiled files and causing Fortran compiler errors) 

For swift/main/@make:
-Change the FFLAGS line so that it reads
	set FFLAGS='-O'
